## How to get started

### Install Docker

Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed. Download link: [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

### Cloning the repository

```bash
git clone <URL of your repository>
cd <your project name>
```

### Building and running containers

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

The application will be available at: http://localhost:8000

## Development

### Working with the database

The database connection configuration is in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

### Adding dependencies

Add the required dependencies in the `requirements.txt` file and rebuild the Docker container.

### Stopping and deleting containers

```bash
docker-compose down
```
